## Introduction

> This article is a continuation of the previous article on deploying a smart contract on the goerli testnet. If you haven't read it yet, you can check it out [here](https://www.bowtiedhamachi.com/articles/my-first-solidity-contract)

In this article, we'll be building out a frontend that interacts nicely with the smart contract that we've deployed on the goerli testnet. We'll be making use of the `web3Modal` library and `ethers` library to interface with the goerli chain.

> Note : There's a lot of room for optimisations for the code admittedly. A sample version of the frontend can be found at https://smart-contract-calculator.vercel.app/ with the code at https://github.com/bthamachi/Smart-Contract-Calculator
> Let's start up a small NextJS application with typescript support.

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest --ts frontend
```

to create a new app called `frontend`. This will create a new folder called `frontend` which will house our frontend code.

```bash
cd frontend  // change this to whatever you named your project
npm install --save web3modal ethers @dethcrypto/eth-sdk @dethcrypto/eth-sdk-client ts-node
```

> Note : We previously deployed our contract at 0x0b8a1019a6E130cc1a8Ad211CA01e02D39fa92d8. Feel free to use an alternative address if you've deployed it elsewhere.

## Generating our Contract Types

Now we need to generate the types for our contract. Let's start by writing a small config file at `eth-sdk/config.ts`

```js
import type { EthSdkConfig } from "@dethcrypto/eth-sdk";

const config: EthSdkConfig = {
  contracts: {
    // We are looking to deploy types for the goerli network
    goerli: {
      // We want to interact with our calculator smart contract at this address
      calculator: "0x0b8a1019a6E130cc1a8Ad211CA01e02D39fa92d8",
    },
  },

  // We want to have our types live in the src/contractTypes folder
  outputPath: "./src/contractTypes/",
};

export default config;
```

Now let's run the `eth-sdk` library which will automatically generate the relevant contracts for us.

```bash
npx eth-sdk
```

This should in turn result in the following output.

```bash
Loaded sdk definition from .../frontend/eth-sdk
✔ Getting ABIs
✔ Generating client
SDK generated to: src/contractTypes
```

With this, we now have a way of calling our smart contracts in a manner that is fully typed.

## Hooking up our wallet

I prefer to use React Context as a way of managing global state variables. This is because we can easily expose global variables using an easy useContext hook.

For this example, we'll be using React wallet to manage access to our user's wallet. Let's start by defining a quick scaffolding for the wallet context.

```js
// src/context/state.js
import { createContext, useContext } from "react";

const WalletContext = createContext();

export function WalletWrapper({ children }) {
  let sharedState = {
    /* whatever you want */
  };

  return (
    <WalletContext.Provider value={sharedState}>
      {children}
    </WalletContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useWalletContext() {
  return useContext(WalletContext);
}
```

We want to expose a few different things

1. A generic contract interface which we can use to call our interface
2. A boolean which we can use to determine if we have a wallet connected.
3. A function to connect our wallets
4. A function to disconnect our wallets

This corresponds to the type as seen below

```ts
type WalletContextType = {
  connectWallet: () => void;
  disconnectWallet: () => void;
  // This is a custom type provided by eth-sdk
  contractInterface: GoerliSdk | undefined;
  isConnected: Boolean;
};
```

> It's important here to note that Web3Modal doesn't ever disconnect your wallet. It only clears the cached provider. Once your wallet has granted permission to a dApp, it has permanent permissions. Make sure to revoke permissions before leaving a site.

First, let's initialise a `Web3Modal` which will allow us to interact with the wallet of the user's choice. This can be done by using a `useEffect` Hook

> By setting the dependency array to `[]`, we effectively only run this once whenever the function renders.

```ts
useEffect(() => {
  const modal = new Web3Modal({
    network: "goerli",
  });
  setModal(modal);
  console.log(modal.cachedProvider);
}, []);
```

We also track a few pieces of state within our context .

```js
const [modal,setModal] = useState<Web3Modal>()
const [sdk,setSdk] = useState<GoerliSdk>()
const [walletConnected,setWalletConnected] = useState(false);
```

Let's continue by implementing a few of the methods

**Connect Wallet**

```ts
const connectWallet = async () => {
  if (!modal) {
    throw new Error("Modal must be initialised to connect wallet");
  }
  //Initialise Information
  const provider = await modal?.connect();
  const web3Provider = await new providers.Web3Provider(provider);
  const signer = web3Provider.getSigner();

  const contracts = getGoerliSdk(signer);

  //Update State
  setSdk(contracts);
  setWalletConnected(true);
};
```

**Disconnect Wallet**

```ts
const disconnectWallet = async () => {
  if (!modal) {
    throw new Error("Modal must be initialised to disconnect wallet");
  }
  await modal?.clearCachedProvider();
  setWalletConnected(false);
};
```

This essentially forms the backbone of our context which will now look something like this

```ts
// src/context/state.js
import { createContext, useContext, useEffect, useState } from "react";
import Web3Modal from "web3modal";
import { providers } from "ethers";
import { getGoerliSdk, GoerliSdk } from "../contractTypes";

type WalletContextType = {
  connectWallet: () => void;
  disconnectWallet: () => void;
  // This is a custom type provided by eth-sdk
  contractInterface: GoerliSdk | undefined;
  isConnected: Boolean;
};

const WalletContext = createContext<WalletContextType>(null!);

//@ts-ignore
export function WalletWrapper({ children }) {
  const [modal, setModal] = useState<Web3Modal>();
  const [sdk, setSdk] = useState<GoerliSdk>();
  const [walletConnected, setWalletConnected] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    const modal = new Web3Modal({
      network: "goerli",
    });
    setModal(modal);
    console.log(modal.cachedProvider);
  }, []);

  const connectWallet = async () => {
    if (!modal) {
      throw new Error("Modal must be initialised to connect wallet");
    }
    //Initialise Information
    const provider = await modal?.connect();
    const web3Provider = await new providers.Web3Provider(provider);
    const signer = web3Provider.getSigner();

    const contracts = getGoerliSdk(signer);

    //Update State
    setSdk(contracts);
    setWalletConnected(true);
  };

  const disconnectWallet = async () => {
    if (!modal) {
      throw new Error("Modal must be initialised to disconnect wallet");
    }
    await modal?.clearCachedProvider();
    setWalletConnected(false);
  };

  let sharedState = {
    connectWallet,
    isConnected: walletConnected,
    disconnectWallet,
    contractInterface: sdk,
  };

  return (
    <WalletContext.Provider value={sharedState}>
      {children}
    </WalletContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useWalletContext() {
  return useContext(WalletContext);
}
```

> Note here that we've exposed a custom `useWalletContext` hook which allows us to easily extract out valuable bits of information whenever we want to.

Now we just need to pop over to `_app.tsx` in our `src/pages` folder to finish off our gander with context

```js
...
const MyApp: AppType = ({ Component, pageProps }) => {
  return <WalletWrapper>
    <Component {...pageProps} />
  </WalletWrapper>
};
...
```

## Calling Contract Functions on our Front End

Now let's look as to how we can call our function on our frontend.

Let's first write up a small component that handles user wallet connects.

```js
import React from "react";
import { useWalletContext } from "../context/WalletContext";

const WalletButton = () => {
  const { connectWallet, isConnected, disconnectWallet } = useWalletContext();

  if (isConnected) {
    return (
      <div className="flex items-center justify-center">
        <p>Wallet Connected!</p>
        <button
          onClick={() => disconnectWallet()}
          className="mx-4 border px-4 py-2"
        >
          Disconnect Wallet
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => connectWallet()}>Connect Wallet</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default WalletButton;
```

All this component does is render a button for users to click to connect to connect their wallet. With this we have the first portion settled.

Next, let's look at how we can call our contract on the frontend. For reference, here is the source code of the contract we'll be interacting with.

```solidity
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Calculator {
    // Code goes here

    function add(int256 a, int256 b) public pure returns (int256) {
        return a + b;
    }

    function minus(int256 a, int256 b) public pure returns (int256) {
        return a - b;
    }
}
```

It has two simple functions - `add` and `minus` which each just operate on two `int256` variables. We can call either of these functions by simply performing

```js
const { contractInterface } = useWalletContext();

contractInterface?.calculator.add(3, 4).then((res) => console.log(res));
```

And that's it! We can then move on to scaffolding out a rough html with the following code.

```js
import type { NextPage } from "next";
import Head from "next/head";
import { useState } from "react";
import WalletButton from "../components/WalletButton";
import { useWalletContext } from "../context/WalletContext";
import React from "react";

const Home: NextPage = () => {
  const [a, setA] = useState("");
  const [b, setB] = useState("");
  const { contractInterface, isConnected } = useWalletContext();

  const [result, setResult] = useState(0);

  const onAdd = async (e: any) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const res = await contractInterface?.calculator.add(
      parseInt(a),
      parseInt(b)
    );
    if (res) {
      setResult(res?.toNumber());
    }
  };

  const onMinus = async (e: any) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const res = await contractInterface?.calculator.minus(
      parseInt(a),
      parseInt(b)
    );
    if (res) {
      setResult(res?.toNumber());
    }
  };

  return (
    <>
      <main className="container mx-auto flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center p-4">
        <WalletButton />
        {!isConnected && (
          <p>Please connect your wallet to see the rest of the app</p>
        )}

        {isConnected && (
          <>
            <p>Your last calculation was {result}</p>
            <div className="flex flex-col">
              <h1>Calculator</h1>
              <form>
                <div>
                  <label>First Value</label>
                  <input
                    onChange={(e) => setA(e.target.value)}
                    value={a}
                    className="mx-4 border"
                    type="text"
                  />
                </div>
                <div>
                  <label>Second Value</label>
                  <input
                    onChange={(e) => setB(e.target.value)}
                    className="mx-4 border"
                    type="text"
                    value={b}
                  />
                </div>

                <button onClick={(e) => onAdd(e)} className="border">
                  Add
                </button>
                <button onClick={(e) => onMinus(e)} className="border">
                  Minus
                </button>
              </form>
            </div>
          </>
        )}
      </main>
    </>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

This gives us a simple user interface which can call the smart contract we've defined easily.
