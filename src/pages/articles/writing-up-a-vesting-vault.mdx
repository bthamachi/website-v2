## Introduction

> All code for this can be found at [the github repo](https://github.com/bthamachi/Smart-Contract-Vault). If you're new to unit testing, I recommend reading [this short introduction](https://bowtiedhamachi.substack.com/p/unit-testing) I wrote sometime back

### What is a vesting vault and why do we need one?

In crypto terms, a Vesting vault is simply a smart contract that locks up some eth or some ERC-20 tokens for a set amount of time before a designated user can claim them. This is a process known as "Vesting".

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111180211/194796226-4b64f06d-3198-45e3-a2a6-5d207a987d92.png" />

There are a few different ways to implement vesting

1. Graded Vesting : The individual is given a set amount of tokens/stock over time. This can either be done in equal portions or with larger chunks given at the tail-end of this period.

2. Cliff Vesting : No tokens or eth are given for an initial period known as a "cliff". Once this "cliff" period is over, the user's tokens or eth are then gradually allocated to him

We normally use a vesting vault so that users do not immediately dump their tokens on the open market. This would result in a sharp decline in the price of the token that is being vested and effectively destroy a large chunk of the capital of the project.

## Specification

> Original Specification can be found here at [BowTiedPickle's tweet](https://twitter.com/BowTiedPickle/status/1577320682395951109).

The main requirements were

- a single beneficiary, set on construction
- a one-time function to fund the vault with ERC-20 tokens and an unlock time set in the future
- only the owner can call fund()
- beneficiary can only withdraw after unlock time.

with additional bonus requirements of

- Implementing a maximum vesting duration
- Allowing users to vest eth
- Implementing a vesting curve (Linear, Linear with cliff)

I personally thought that implementing a complicated vesting curve would add additional complexity to this so my final choice of specifications left out the vesting curve and maximum vesting duration. In conclusion, our contract will have a few public functions

1. A constructor() that will take in a beneficiary address
2. a fund() method that can be called by the owner of the contract
3. a withdraw() method that will be used by the benficiary to withdraw his money
4. a blacklistBenificiary() method that can be used by the owner to kill the vesting process as a fail safe.

> All of these methods will be public so we need to implement some safeguards in order to make sure that we have the right access controls.

## Unit Testing

### Configuration

We can start by creating a new Hardhat project with

> Make sure to choose a typescript project!

```
npm init -y
npm install --save hardhat
npx hardhat
npm install --save npm typechain @typechain/ethers-v5
```

We also need to configure out `hardhat.config.ts` file so that it works nicely with typechain

> Typechain is useful because it allows us to generate types for our contract. This makes testing significantly easier to work with!

```
import { HardhatUserConfig } from "hardhat/config";
import "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox";
import '@typechain/hardhat'
import '@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers'

const config: HardhatUserConfig = {
  solidity: "0.8.17",
};

export default config;
```

Let's start by scaffolding out a quick test file for our unit testing

```js
import { expect } from "chai";
import { ethers } from "hardhat";
import { SignerWithAddress } from "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers/signers";
import {
  HamachiToken,
  HamachiToken__factory,
  VestingVault,
  VestingVault__factory,
} from "../typechain-types";
import { time } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers";
import { BigNumber } from "ethers";

const totalSupply = (10 ** 9).toString();

describe("Vesting Vault", function () {
  let HamachiToken: HamachiToken;
  let VestingVault: VestingVault;
  let owner: SignerWithAddress;
  let addr1: SignerWithAddress;
  let addr2: SignerWithAddress;
  let addrs: SignerWithAddress[];

  let beneficiary: SignerWithAddress;

  beforeEach(async function () {
    // Provision Addresses first
    [owner, addr1, addr2, ...addrs] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // Create Contract Interfaces
    const HamachiTokenFactory: HamachiToken__factory =
      await ethers.getContractFactory("HamachiToken", owner);
    const VestingVaultFactory: VestingVault__factory =
      await ethers.getContractFactory("VestingVault", owner);

    //Set Constants

    beneficiary = addr1;

    //Deploy Contracts
    HamachiToken = await HamachiTokenFactory.deploy(
      ethers.utils.parseEther(totalSupply)
    );
    VestingVault = await VestingVaultFactory.deploy(beneficiary.address);
  });

  //Other tests go here
});
```

### Writing Our Tests

Let's start by breaking down the overall functionality of the smart contract into three main sections - deployment, funding, before unlock time and withdrawals.

### Deployment

1. A user should be able to deploy this contract and set a beneficiary. We should provide some variables that show that

   - Wallet has not been funded
   - Beneficiary has been set

2. Owner is set properly and should be owned by the person who deployed the contract.

This corresponds to the following unit tests

```ts
describe("Deployment", function () {
  it("should be initialised with a set beneficiary", async function () {
    expect(await VestingVault.beneficiary()).to.equal(beneficiary.address);
    expect(await VestingVault.funded()).to.equal(false);
  });

  it("should throw an error when withdraw is called when initialised", async function () {
    await expect(VestingVault.withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith(
      "Vesting Vault has not been funded, please try again later"
    );
  });

  it("should be owned by the person who deployed the contract", async function () {
    expect(await VestingVault.owner()).to.be.equal(owner.address);
  });
});
```

### Funding

When it comes to funding, there are three things we need to check

1. We are accurately restricting access to the fund() function to the owner
2. Valid inputs are being passed to our fund() function
3. We can fund our function with an ERC-20 token and/or eth

This corresponds to the unit tests below

```js
describe("Funding", function () {
        // Input Checks
        it("Should throw an error if owner sets a vesting duration of 0", async function () {
            await expect(VestingVault.fund(0, HamachiToken.address, 1000)).to.be.revertedWith("Vesting Duration needs to be non-zero!")
        })

        it("Should throw an error if owner provides an invalid ERC-20 token address", async function () {
            await expect(VestingVault.fund(40, addr1.address, 1000)).to.be.reverted
        })


        // Functionality Checks
        it("should be funded with a set number amount of ERC-20 tokens", async function () {
            const vestingDuration = (10 ** 4) //this is in seconds
            const fundedAmount = 1000

            await HamachiToken.approve(VestingVault.address, fundedAmount)
            await VestingVault.fund(vestingDuration, HamachiToken.address, fundedAmount)
            const addressBalance = await HamachiToken.balanceOf(VestingVault.address)
            expect(addressBalance).to.be.equal(fundedAmount)
            expect(await VestingVault.funded()).to.be.true
            expect(await VestingVault.vestingVaultValue()).to.be.equal(fundedAmount)
        })

        it("should support funding for Eth", async function () {
            const vestingDuration = (10 ** 4) //this is in seconds
            const fundedAmount = 1000

            await HamachiToken.approve(VestingVault.address, fundedAmount)
            await VestingVault.fund(vestingDuration, HamachiToken.address, fundedAmount, { from: owner.address, value: 1 })
            const addressBalance = await HamachiToken.balanceOf(VestingVault.address)
            expect(addressBalance).to.be.equal(fundedAmount)
            expect(await VestingVault.funded()).to.be.true
            expect(await VestingVault.vestingVaultValue()).to.be.equal(fundedAmount)
            expect(await VestingVault.provider.getBalance(VestingVault.address)).to.be.equal(1)
        })
```

### Withdrawal

When looking at the withdrawal functions, we want to make sure that we implement a few logic checks

1. Only the beneficiary should be able to withdraw the money, If the function is called before the time is up, an error should be thrown.
2. All of the eth and the ERC-20 token value should be deposited in the benficiary's wallet.
3. The owner should be able to cancel the vesting proccess. If this is done, then all the eth should be withdrawn from the contract and transfered to the owner. The benficiary should be prohibited from withdrawing the money thereafter.

This corresponds to the unit tests below

```js
describe("Withdrawal for pure ERC-20 Withdrawals", function () {
  it("should be disabled once the user blacklisted", async function () {
    const vestingDuration = 10 ** 4;
    const fundedAmount = 1000;
    await HamachiToken.approve(VestingVault.address, fundedAmount);
    await VestingVault.fund(
      vestingDuration,
      HamachiToken.address,
      fundedAmount
    );
    await VestingVault.blacklistBeneficiary();
    await expect(
      VestingVault.connect(beneficiary).withdraw()
    ).to.be.revertedWith(
      "Owner has prematurely cancelled vesting and prohibited beneficiary from recieving funds"
    );
  });

  it("should not able to call withdrawal before the vault is funded", async function () {
    await expect(VestingVault.withdraw()).to.be.revertedWith(
      "Vesting Vault has not been funded, please try again later"
    );
  });

  });
});
```

## Smart Contract

Let's now scaffold out a quick smart contract with the functions we talked about earlier

```sol
//SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/interfaces/IERC20.sol";
import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract VestingVault is Ownable {
    address payable public beneficiary;
    uint256 public unlockTime;
    uint256 public vestingVaultValue;
    bool public funded;
    bool vaultRedeemed;
    IERC20 token;
    bool vestingCancelled;

    /////////////////
    // Constructor //
    /////////////////
    constructor(address _beneficiary) {

    }

    /////////////////
    // Code        //
    /////////////////
    function fund(
        uint256 _vestingDuration,
        address ERC20Token,
        uint256 _tokenFunding
    ) public payable onlyOwner {

    }


    function withdraw() public {

    }
}

```

Let's point out a few things here that we've declared

1. We've imported in the OpenZeppelin `Ownable` contract. This allows for us to get access to two things - the onlyOwner modifier and the a \_owner variable without doing anything. These are automatically set to the account holder that is deploying the contract

2. We've declared our main functiosn - fund, withdraw,blacklist and the constructor with function signatures. Note that these are `public` by default so they can be called by other users or contracts

### Constructor

The constructor is simple enough, all we need is to declare a generic constructor that takes in an address which we can then set to the local beneficiary value

```
constructor(address _beneficiary) {
    beneficiary = _beneficiary;
}
```

> We've used `_beneficiary` to indicate the private value that is being passed into the function. This is a common pattern used by many solidity developers.

### fund() method

Our fund method takes in a few parameters `_vestingDuration`, `ERC20Token`, `_tokenFunding` and is also payable. This means that users are able to send eth along with their transaction. We also use the `require` function to check that we have a valid vesting duration and a successful transfer of balance from the token.

We also use the `IERC20` interface provided by `OpenZeppelin` to allow our smart contract to call the ERC20 token.

```
function fund(
        uint256 _vestingDuration,
        address ERC20Token,
        uint256 _tokenFunding
    ) public payable onlyOwner {
        require(_vestingDuration > 0, "Vesting Duration needs to be non-zero!");
        token = IERC20(ERC20Token);
        unlockTime = block.timestamp + _vestingDuration;

        //Transfer funded amount to contract;
        bool fundingSuccess = token.transferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            _tokenFunding
        );
        require(
            fundingSuccess,
            "Transfer from ERC20 Contract Failed. Please check your balance"
        );

        funded = true;
        vestingVaultValue = _tokenFunding;
    }
```

### blacklistBeneficiary

We now need a function as a kill switch in case the owner of the smart contract wants to kill a specific vesting proccess. Let's breakdown the flow

1. We need to update our `vestingCancelled` boolean variable to true so that withdrawls are paused
2. We need to withdraw all the Eth in the contract and transfer to the owner
3. We need to withdraw all the ERC-20 tokens in the contract and transfer to the owner.

Let's first write some helper functions to do (2) and (3).

```
function withdrawEth() internal returns (bool) {
    if (address(this).balance == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    (bool sent, bytes memory data) = msg.sender.call{
        value: address(this).balance
    }("");
    return sent;
}

function withdrawERC20() internal returns (bool) {
    if (token.balanceOf(address(this)) == 0) {
        return true;
    }
    bool succesfulTokenTransfer = token.transfer(
        msg.sender,
        vestingVaultValue
    );
    return succesfulTokenTransfer;
}
```

> By doing a quick check to make sure that we have a non-zero balance, we save some gas money~

Now let's write up our `blacklistBeneficiary` function

```
function blacklistBeneficiary() public onlyOwner {
    // Update vesting cancelled
    vestingCancelled = true;

    // Withdraw contract money
    withdrawEth();
    withdrawERC20();
}
```

Notice here that we essentially allow the Owner to do this multiple times in the event that they don't have enough gas.

### Withdrawal

We need to check a few things before allowing the user to withdraw

1. The user needs to be the named beneficiary
2. The unlock time needs to have passed
3. The vault must have been funded
4. The Vested tokens must not have been redeemed

```
function withdraw() public {
        require(
            funded,
            "Vesting Vault has not been funded, please try again later"
        );
        require(
            msg.sender == beneficiary,
            "Only beneficiary can withdraw money from this contract"
        );

        require(
            !vestingCancelled,
            "Owner has prematurely cancelled vesting and prohibited beneficiary from recieving funds"
        );
        require(
            !vaultRedeemed,
            "Vault's vested tokens have already been redeemed"
        );
        require(
            block.timestamp >= unlockTime,
            "Vesting duration has not been completed, please try again later"
        );
        require(!vaultRedeemed, "Vault has already been redeemed");

        // We transfer all our ERC-20 tokens and Eth to the beneficiary
        withdrawCurrentBalance();
        vaultRedeemed = true;
    }
}
```

We also define a helper function that wraps around `withdrawEth` and `withdrawERC20` that we call `withdrawCurrentBalance`. This is special because it checks that the money has been succesfully transfered before we set `vaultRedeemed` to be true.

```
function withdrawCurrentBalance() internal returns (bool) {
    bool succesfulEthTransfer = withdrawEth();
    bool succesfulErc20Transfer = withdrawERC20();

    require(succesfulErc20Transfer, "ERC20 Withdrawal failed");
    require(succesfulEthTransfer, "Eth Withdrawl failed, try again");
    return true;
}
```

With that, we have a valid smart contract!
